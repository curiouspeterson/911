# **Project Context Guide**

This file tracks the high-level status of the project to provide clear, immediate context for development.

*Last Updated: July 27, 2025*

## **✅ Completed:**

*   **Task 0: Algorithm Spike** - The TypeScript-native scheduling POC was successful, validating the core logic.
*   **Task 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure** - The project is fully configured with Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript, Vitest, and Sentry. The local development environment is stable.
*   **Task 2: Centralized Error Handling** - Sentry is integrated for error reporting across the application.
*   **Task 3: Authentication and RBAC** - A complete authentication flow and a robust Role-Based Access Control system using Supabase RLS and Next.js middleware are implemented and tested. Includes a user management feature for admins.
*   **Task 4: Database Schema Implementation** - The complete database schema, including tables for users, roles, shifts, schedules, and staffing requirements, has been implemented via Supabase migrations.

## **InProgress In Progress:**

*   **Task 6: Read-Only Schedule View** - The core calendar view is being implemented.
    *   **Sub-task 6.4: Coverage Gap Highlighting:** The logic for identifying and highlighting staffing gaps is written, but the corresponding Vitest test is currently **failing**. This is the immediate focus.

## **⏭️ Up Next:**

*   **Task 5: User Profile Management** - Build the interface for users to view and manage their own profile information.
*   **Task 8: Automated Schedule Generation** - Integrate the scheduling algorithm to automatically generate schedules based on staffing requirements and constraints.
*   **Task 9: Manual Schedule Management** - Develop the interface for supervisors to manually create, update, and delete shifts.
