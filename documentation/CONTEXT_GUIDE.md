# **Project Context Guide**

This file tracks the high-level status of the project to provide clear, immediate context for development.

*Last Updated: July 26, 2025*

## **✅ Completed:**

* **Task 1 (Partial): Project Setup** \- The project has been successfully initialized using the Supabase \+ Next.js starter template.  
* **Task 3 (Partial): Core Authentication** \- A complete, functional authentication flow (signup, login, logout, password reset) is in place from the starter template.

## **InProgress In Progress:**

* **Task 0: Algorithm Spike** \- Currently focused on building the proof-of-concept for the core scheduling engine to validate its feasibility with Google OR-Tools. This is the highest priority to de-risk the project.

## **⏭️ Up Next:**

* **Task 4: Database Schema Implementation** \- The immediate next step is to create the application-specific database schema (tables for employees, roles, shifts, etc.) via a new Supabase migration.  
* **Task 3: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** \- Once the schema is in place, we will extend the existing authentication system by implementing the roles and user\_roles tables and enforcing permissions via RLS.
