# Task ID: 3
# Title: Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the existing Supabase Auth to include application-specific roles and permissions (FR-2.0).
# Details:
1. Implement the database schema for `roles` and `user_roles`.
2. Create a trigger or server-side function to assign a default role on user sign-up.
3. Implement role-based access control within Server Actions and Middleware by checking against the `roles` table.
4. Adapt existing auth UI components if necessary and build admin UI for role management.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for permission checking functions.
2. Integration tests for role assignment on signup.
3. Test RLS policies with different user roles.
4. Verify protected routes and actions are correctly restricted by role.
