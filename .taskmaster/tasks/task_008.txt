# Task ID: 8
# Title: Automated Schedule Generation Algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 0 (Not found), 4, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core scheduling engine that generates compliant 4-month schedules (FR-6.0).
# Details:
1. Implement a constraint-based scheduling algorithm using Google OR-Tools, based on the successful POC from Task 0.
2. Define all scheduling constraints from the PRD in the solver.
3. Implement schedule generation as a Server Action.
4. Add detailed logging and validation for the scheduling process.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for individual constraints.
2. Integration tests for the complete algorithm.
3. Performance testing with realistic data volumes.
4. Validation tests to ensure all constraints are satisfied.
