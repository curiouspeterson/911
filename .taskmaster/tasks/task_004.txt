# Task ID: 4
# Title: Database Schema Design and Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: critical
# Description: Design and implement the application-specific database schema based on the PRD (Section 7).
# Details:
1. Create all required tables in Supabase (employees, roles, shifts, staffing_requirements, etc.).
2. Implement foreign key constraints and indexes for performance.
3. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for each new table.
4. Create a new Supabase migration file for the application schema.
5. Create seed data scripts for development and testing of the new tables.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all tables are created with correct schemas.
2. Test foreign key constraints.
3. Validate RLS policies with different user roles.
4. Verify seed data scripts populate the database correctly.
