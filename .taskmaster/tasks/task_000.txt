# Task ID: 0
# Title: Task 0: Algorithm Spike - Scheduling Engine Proof-of-Concept
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: critical
# Description: De-risk the project by building a focused proof-of-concept (POC) of the core scheduling algorithm using Google OR-Tools and dummy data. This task must validate the technical feasibility of solving the primary scheduling constraints before full application development begins.
# Details:
1. Define a minimal, representative subset of scheduling constraints from the PRD (Section 5.1 & 5.2).
2. Create a script with hardcoded dummy data (e.g., 20 employees, 1 month of shifts).
3. Implement a basic constraint model using Google OR-Tools to solve for the dummy data.
4. The primary goal is to confirm that a valid schedule can be generated, not to build a production-ready engine.
5. Document the findings, including performance metrics and any identified challenges or limitations.

# Test Strategy:
1. The success of this task is a binary outcome: does the POC script successfully generate a valid schedule that meets the core constraints?
2. Verify the output schedule manually against the dummy data and constraints.
3. Measure the time taken to generate the schedule.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define POC Scope and Dummy Data Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select the most critical constraints (e.g., min staffing, 40-hour week) and design a simple TypeScript interface for the dummy data.
### Details:


## 2. Implement OR-Tools Constraint Solver Script [pending]
### Dependencies: 0.1
### Description: Write the core POC script that models the constraints and attempts to find a solution.
### Details:


## 3. Analyze Results and Document Findings [pending]
### Dependencies: 0.2
### Description: Run the script, analyze the generated schedule for correctness, and write a summary report of the findings, including a recommendation to proceed.
